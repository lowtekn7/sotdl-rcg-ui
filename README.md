# Shadow of the Demon Lord Random Character Generator UI

This is a random character generator for the game Shadow of the Demon Lord. Currently it supports the core rulebook with some spells included from Occult Philosophy.

You can create characters of any level, ancestry, and legal path combination.

## Implemented features

- From the Core book:
  - All Ancestries
  - All Novice, Expert, Master Paths
  - All Professions
  - All Traditions and Spells
  - Marks of Darkness
  - All Interesting Things
- Marks of Darkness on Corruption Gain
- Corruption Gain on learning a Dark Tradition
- Potential Corruption Gain on learning Dark Spells
- Additional money on level up
- Interesting Things at every new Path selection
- and more... (probably -- I'm sure there's some things I didn't list here)

## Things worthy of note

- Rules text is intentionally not included. While it would be nice to have, it would make purchase of the book less likely
- The AI making decisions simply picks a random item from the list of options -- don't expect characters to be optimized in any way
- Not all items are added, and there is no consideration for equipping characters. Additional money is given however, so use that to purchase equipment
- When printing a character, you may see a second blank page. This is done to work around a browser related issue where columns become "balanced" instead of filling the available space. Just don't print the second page -- save the paper.
